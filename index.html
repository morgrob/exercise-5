      <h1>Panic! At the Disco</h1>

      <p>
        Originally formed in 2004 by childhood friends, Ryan Ross, Spencer
        Smith, Brent Wilson and Brendon Urie, Panic! at the Disco was one of the
        biggest bands to emerge from the emo movement of the mid-2000s. At
        present, Brendon Urie is the only member of the band, making it more of
        a solo project. Panic! At the Disco has released 6 albums, the most
        recent being <i>Pray for the Wicked</i>, released in 2018.

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>

<div class="lyrics">
      
      <blockquote>
        Whether near or far,<br>I am always yours.<br>Any change in time,<br>We are young
        again...
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        These lyrics are from "The End of All Things" on <i>Too Weird to Live, Too
        Rare to Die</i>. At the time that this album was about the come out, Brendon
        Urie had just gotten married, and this song is all about how much he
        loves his new wife. The lyrics of this song are actual wedding vows that
        Brendon and his wife exchanged at their wedding. There are only two
        verses to this song, making it so simple and beautiful.<br>
        
        <br>To me, this song is just very nostalgic because I've been listening to
        Panic! At the Disco since I was in middle school. The album with this
        song on it came out when I was in seventh grade and I remember begging
        my mom to buy the CD for me so I could listen to it on repeat.
